Version 1.0, February 15, 2013

##Introduction

Welcome, OUYA Devs! We’re thrilled you’ve decided to develop for OUYA.

We want to provide a great experience for both gamers and developers, which is why we will review all Games and Apps (read “Games”) you submit to OUYA. Below are the guidelines we’ll use. Of course, we are open to any developer -- but we want all the games on OUYA to come together to make OUYA great.

By following the guidelines below, young grasshopper, you’ll be live on OUYA before you know it (Yeah!). We will try to keep this document as stable as possible, and communicate if we need to make changes.

##Speed of Reply

We understand your need to get feedback quickly and we are committed to making this happen as it benefits you, our developers, as well as OUYA’s gamers.

Last week, it took us three days to review an average Game.  We’ll update this weekly for you.

##Content No-No’s

We want you to build imaginative, inventive games. To make sure OUYA has a great environment for gamers, there are a few things we don’t want to see on OUYA. First, make sure to rate your game according to OUYA’s Content Rating Guidelines below (be honest).  Then, let’s avoid these:

* **Hate Speech**: Do not promote hatred toward an individual or group of people based on their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity in your game.  If you do, we’ll reject it.

* **Violence**: Do not encourage real world violence, in any way.

* **Sexually Explicit Content**: Don’t go overboard on nudity or obscene references… you know what we mean.

* **Misrepresentation** (of your Game or Yourself): Be who you say you are. Don’t confuse gamers by being “like” other games.

* **Intellectual Property**: Do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, and all other proprietary rights.

* **Dangerous Products**: Do not transmit viruses, worms, malware, or any other items that may harm gamers or the OUYA platform.

* **Illegal Activities**: Use good judgment and do not break the law.

* **OUYA Trademark**: You can use the OUYA name, logo, and trademark, but you have to respect that these are OUYA’s intellectual property, so we want you to use them in a way that accurately portrays that your game is on OUYA.

##In-App Purchasing & Technical Info

You have to use OUYA’s In-App Payment API to take any payment. The In-App Payment API can be found in our OUYA Development Kit (ODK) at devs.ouya.tv.  It supports micro-transactions and full game downloads as well as any content you want to unlock.

You shouldn’t mislead users about any in-app services, goods, content or functionality.

No nasty bugs please!  If your game regularly crashes or has awful bugs, or otherwise don’t perform as described, we’ll reject it.

Your game should continue to work even if a network connection goes down (excluding any online functionality, of course).

All games must function on a retail OUYA device, without modifications to hardware or software.

The size of the initial Game’s download (the .apk file) should be 750MB or less. If a Game requires additional files or assets, they should be delivered via your own servers.

Games should run in full-screen mode (it is TV ya know).

Games should follow the OUYA [Interface Guidelines](https://devs.ouya.tv/developers/docs/interface-guidelines), including the names of the controller buttons and related UI standards.


##OUYA Content Ratings Guidelines

To help expedite your game’s review, we ask that you assign a content rating to your game that reflects the appropriateness of its content for different audience. The rating scale is as follows:

**Heavy**: Your game contains heavy use of simulated violence, adult language or situations, or your game allows access to that kind of  content via streaming video, audio or the open web.

**Moderate**: Your game contains moderate use of simulated violence and sparse use of adult language or situations.

**Light**: If your game contains any violence, it’s light and cartoonish. Your game does not contain any adult language or situations and does not allow access to such content via streaming video or audio. Your game does not allow access to the open web.

##Communication

In the event we reject your Game -- including for reasons that may not be captured within this document -- we will let you know by email, along with a brief description of why. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your Game and/or let us know if you disagree with our decision.

So go make some great games...
