## ODK Roadmap

**Important Note:** This preview version of the ODK is a work in progress, and is still under heavy development.
* **Payments security** - We are still implementing these features. Your test calls to our payments API will work, but we will add new security features when real-money payments go live.
* **Launcher** - This is still in its earliest stages of development. For example, we are still implementing the display of game information like description, screenshots, etc. This will launch when we launch the gamer-facing discovery service.
* **Controllers** - The method used to associate a player with a specific game controller is a work in progress. The controller LEDs do not yet indicate the player number.

Please post your feedback on the [developer forums](http://forums.ouya.tv). We know there is a lot to complete, and we want your help in shaping it.
