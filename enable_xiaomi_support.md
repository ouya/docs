# Enabling Xiaomi Support

While being included in the Xiaomi market is currently an invite-only process, making your app Xiaomi-Enabled is a relatively simple affair.

## Update to the latest ODK

Download the following ODK: https://ouya-sdks.s3.amazonaws.com/xiaomi/odk-rc-1.2.1472.zip

## Add the necessary files to your build

* Download and extract [SDK_MIBOX_2.0.1](https://ouya-sdks.s3.amazonaws.com/xiaomi/SDK_MIBOX_2.0.1.zip)
* Place **SDK_MIBOX_2.0.1.jar** with the libraries of your game
* Place **MiGameCenterSDKService.apk** in your <game>/assets directory.

## Add the required permissions

Xiaomi's SDK requires several additional permissions in order to work.
```java
	<uses-permission android:name="com.xiaomi.sdk.permission.PAYMENT"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_TASKS"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

## Update your OuyaFacade initialization bundle

The Xiaomi market requires a special application key and ID.  Contact the [OUYA team](mailto:xiaomisupport@ouya.tv) to get these values.

Additionally, non-OUYA markets require being pre-informed about all possible product IDs that might be used during the game's run.  This is so the SDK can do any transforms that are specific to the market that the game is connecting to.

```java
	// Your developer id can be found in the Developer Portal
	public static final String DEVELOPER_ID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";

	// Both of these values will be emailed to you by the OUYA team after you've been 
	// selected by the OUYA team
	public static final String XIAOMI_APP_ID = "0000000000000";
	public static final String XIAOMI_APP_KEY = "000000000000000000";

	// All product IDs that might be used
	public static final String[] ALL_PRODUCT_IDS = new String[] {
		"long_sword",
		"sharp_axe",
		"100_extra_lives"
	}

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		Bundle developerInfo = new Bundle();

		// "tv.ouya.developer_id"
		developerInfo.putString(OuyaFacade.OUYA_DEVELOPER_ID, DEVELOPER_ID);
		
		developerInfo.putByteArray(OuyaFacade.OUYA_DEVELOPER_PUBLIC_KEY, loadApplicationKey());

		// We must tell the OuyaFacade that we can use the Xiaomi market for purchases.
		
		// "tv.ouya.xiaomi_app_id"
		developerInfo.putString(OuyaFacade.XIAOMI_APPLICATION_ID, XIAOMI_APP_ID);
		
		// "tv.ouya.xiaomi_app_key"
		developerInfo.putString(OuyaFacade.XIAOMI_APPLICATION_KEY, XIAOMI_APP_KEY);
		
		// "tv.ouya.product_id_list"
		developerInfo.putStringArray(OuyaFacade.OUYA_PRODUCT_ID_LIST, ALL_PRODUCT_IDS);

		OuyaFacade.getInstance().init(this, developerInfo);
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	}
```

## Create a Xiaomi-specific icon

The application icon on Xiaomi is a little unusual.  It will exist in the xhdpi resolution, but it is not a standard Android icon.

* **res/drawable-xhdpi**:
	* File must be named "ouya_xiaomi_icon.png"
    * 284x160, 32-bit
    * 15px rounded corners 
    * Hero element
    	* Size 284x110
    * Game name
    	* Bottom 50px
    	* Background should be a solid color
    	* No actual text - will be inserted by system at runtime.
    * NOTE: Do NOT update your AndroidManifest.xml to reference ouya_xiaomi_icon - you only need to place the asset in the correct location.
    * See [this example](res/game_tile_alt.png)

	![this example](res/game_tile_alt.png)

## Xiaomi requires a .psd image.
* Xiaomi also requires a 800x800 image of the protagonist character(s), or something showing what the game is about.
	* Must be in PSD format.
	* Should be sent directly to the [OUYA team](mailto:xiaomisupport@ouya.tv)

## Localization Resources

* Use [Android localization](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html) to include a `Simplified Chinese` string resource. [Localization Example](https://github.com/ouya/ouya-sdk-examples/tree/master/Android/AndroidExit)

## Submission

Once the above changes have been made, your updated APK should be submitted via the OUYA Developer portal.  You'll then need to email OUYA at [xiaomisupport@ouya.tv](mailto:xiaomisupport@ouya.tv) to let us know it's ready.  Once you've done that, we'll take a snapshot of the in-app-purchase products that you have and send them to Xiaomi.  Please make sure that you've created any necessary in-app-purchase products **BEFORE** telling us your submission is ready.  This email is also when you should send OUYA your protagonist PSD file.

## TL;DR
	* Update to the https://ouya-sdks.s3.amazonaws.com/xiaomi/odk-rc-1.2.1472.zip ODK.
	* Add files to your game project - Xiaomi SDK and Xiaomi's game service apk.
	* Add required permissions to your manifest.
	* Update OuyaFacade's initialization bundle.
	* Create new icon per Xiaomi's requirements
	* Create 800x800 PSD of protagonist.
	* Submit updated apk to OUYA's dev portal
	* Email OUYA to let us know it's ready; include your protagonist PSD.

## That's it!

Wasn't that easy?  :)
