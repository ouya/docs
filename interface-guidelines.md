## Interface Guidelines

Games can use the OUYA controller buttons however they wish, but we recommend the mappings below for the **O**, **U**, **Y**, and **A** buttons. If you are running a stock Android application that is not OUYA-aware, this is also how the buttons will be mapped to the standard Android navigation buttons on the navigation bar for a typical device.
```text
OUYA    Color    Default Function
O       green    select
U       blue     options (Android's menu function)
Y       yellow   -
A       red      back/cancel
```

Please use the naming conventions below when referring to the controller buttons in help screens for your game:
```text
O, U, Y, A
System (the home button)
D-Pad 
LS (the left joystick movement)
L1 (the left bumper)
L2 (the left trigger)
L3 (the button function of pressing the left joystick straight down)
RS
R1
R2
R3
Touchpad (not "Trackpad")
```
If you wish, you may also incorporate the button icons below into help screens for your game.
